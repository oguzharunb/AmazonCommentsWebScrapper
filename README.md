# Amazon Comments Web Scrapper

### In this project, I have created a web scrapper that scrapes comments of a product from Amazon. The comments are stored in a JSON file. Project uses BeautifulSoup library to scrape the comments from Amazon website.

# Set links.json file to your liking. Get category links, paste it into links.json file. Change page=2 to page=1.
